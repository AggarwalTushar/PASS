The transitions between slides are well-structured, and the author uses clear and concise summaries to guide the audience through the presentation.\n\nHowever, there are a few areas where the transitions could be improved. For example, the slide on \"Impact of Document Context on Acceptability Ratings\" feels a bit abrupt, and it would be helpful to have a smoother transition from the methodology slide to this one. Additionally, the final slide on \"Related Work and Future Research Directions\" feels a bit disconnected from the rest of the presentation, and it would be beneficial to have a clearer connection between the results and the future research directions.\n\nOverall, the presentation is well-structured, and the author has done a good job of guiding the audience through the research topic.
